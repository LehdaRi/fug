FUG Game Engine
===

FUG is a game engine driven by data-oriented design approach.
For defining game objects, instead of traditional OOP inheritance
hierarchies a component-entity system (ECS) is used.
In its core FUG defines a number of interfaces implemented as
singleton objects such as Scene, EventManager and ResourceManager.
